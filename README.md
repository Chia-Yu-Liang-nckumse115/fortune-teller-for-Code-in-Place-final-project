## Description
As someone who’s quite superstitious, I’ve always believed in fortune-telling — from zodiac signs and lucky colors to lucky directions. Inspired by traditional Chinese rituals, I was fascinated by an ancient way people seek answers from the gods using a practice called Bwa Bwei (or Moon Block Divination). In this ritual, two crescent-shaped wooden blocks are tossed to receive divine guidance: one flat and one curved means “yes,” both curved means the gods are playfully laughing, and both flat means “no.” Traditionally, people repeat the toss three times to confirm the final message. Combining this centuries-old custom with my love for digital creation, I built this program to blend Eastern and Western fortune-telling traditions.
